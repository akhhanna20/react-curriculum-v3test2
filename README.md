# README

This repo contains the materials for Intro to React V3 curriculum. This 15 week course covers the basics of React and its use in authoring SPAs. The weekly lessons build upon a hypothetical online store, CTD-Swag and a few other smaller apps to illustrate the concepts being presented. Students work on a todo-list app for weekly assignments and a final, open-ended, project that demonstrates an understanding of materials presented.
