# React.js Learning Objectives
***Note**: These learning objectives represent version 3 of CTD's React curriculum, the current version. Version 4 will be released in spring 2026.*

## Overall Objectives

In this course, students will:

  * **Build dynamic, user-centered web applications using modern React tools and best practices.**
Students will develop fluency with core React concepts—components, hooks, state, props, and routing—to design and build responsive, interactive user interfaces, incorporating styling, data fetching, and performance optimization.
  * **Apply real-world software development workflows to plan, build, and deploy React projects.**
Students will structure and refactor code for scalability, manage complex application state, use version control, and integrate third-party libraries and testing tools to deliver polished, production-ready applications through a final project.
