### Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, we will:

#### Objective 1: Advanced State

- Discuss problems of state management in growing applications
- Introduce the reducer pattern
- Describe reducers, dispatches, and actions

#### Objective 2: Manage state with useReducer

- describe useReducer and how it implements the reducer pattern
- implement useReducer to combine related state

#### Objective 3: Passing Data Using useContext
