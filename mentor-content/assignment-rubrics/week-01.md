# Assignment Rubric, Week 01

## Expected App Capabilities

After completing this week's assignment, the student's app should:

- [ ] be in a version controlled directory linked to a GitHub repo
- [ ] uses the latest version of [Vite's React template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) using JavaScript (no TS or SWC)
- [ ] start up on port 5173 with no console errors or warnings
- [ ] render a title and an unordered list of text strings

## Technical Details

- [ ] App component returns a heading and an unordered list that contains 1 or more text-based list items
- [ ] If student installs Prettier or ESLint, ensure configs are accurate.

## Details to Watch For

- [ ] student submits a link other than a [PR](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/react-curriculum-v3/blob/main/learns-app-content/lessons/week-00.md#curriculum-outline)
  - ⚠️ mark assignment as "needs revisions" and have them resubmit with proper link which includes ``/pull/`` in the title
- [ ] all of the template's excess code is removed
  - ℹ️ see student's assignment section, "Clean up Template" ["Clean up Template"](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/react-curriculum-v3/blob/main/learns-app-content/assignments/week-01.md#clean-up-template)
- [ ] make sure there are no Yarn artifacts (all work is done with npm)

## Code Hygiene Recommendations

*We leave the code hygiene details to the discretion of the reviewer but also recommend a few general considerations:*

- [ ] consistent formatting and block nesting
- [ ] short, meaningful value names
- [ ] repo contains no unused code
  - [ ] no commented out code
  - [ ] no unused imports/variables
  - [ ] no redundant imports eg: `import React from 'react'`
- [ ] comments should be short and accurate
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier can automate formatting and bad practice identification. This leaves more space to focus on learning React and improves student/mentor interaction. Implementation instructions are in [week 1's stretch goals](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/react-curriculum-v3/blob/main/learns-app-content/assignments/week-01.md#stretch-goals-instructions-optional).
