# Video-Scripts

Videos for the Intro to React course are meant to be an alternative way to consume the material presented in the course. A video will cover 1 or 2 topics from the week and each week will have 1 or more videos. We should aim to keep each video 5-8 minutes in length to keep them digestible and reference-able. Time constraints are aspirational so a video can be longer for a lengthy or complex topic. This will probably be the case for weeks 00, 01, 12, 13, and 14.

Videos will use a consistent, branded intro and outro for each video. To maximize learning time, the intro should only be a few seconds long. Ideally, it should be long enough to pull in the student's focus but not long enough to considerably lengthen any video. Outro can be longer since it can be skipped by the student. It should at the very least mention that the video description contains references to further reading, give credit to the volunteer who recorded the video, and the person doing post-production.

The video description should provide:

- a brief description of the materials covered
- time markers for each topic if the video covers more than 1 topic
- links to documentation or articles that further cover the topic(s)

The scripts for each section will be written as outlines to provide the volunteer recorder to bring their own voice and personality to that video's material. The only constraint here is that they should not omit any talking points and should provide coding examples that are in line with the CTD-Swag app presented in the curriculum.
